# Project Euler
The purpose of this repo is to catalogue my solutions to the Project Euler coding challenges.

## Running the code
This was originally written in Python 2 with an eye towards compatbility with Python 3. I'm currently in the process of resurrecting this codebase so that it can be run with a modern Python 3 installation. The idea is that you can

1. Download the repo
2. cd into the directory
3. Run the code with a `python [problem number].py` and see the results

An important aspect of Project Euler solutions is that they run in under a minute. Therefore, all problems are timed.
